> Water sediment coagulation chemical for clarifying muddy and unclear scuba diving areas.
#

To conceptualize a water sediment coagulation chemical for clarifying muddy and unclear water for scuba divers, we need to consider a compound that is environmentally friendly, non-toxic to marine life, and efficient in causing sediment particles to coagulate and settle to the bottom. An ideal chemical would work quickly without disturbing the aquatic ecosystem.

### Conceptual Chemical Design

Polyaluminum Chloride (PAC):

- Formula: [Al2(OH)nCl6-n]m

- Description: PAC is widely used in water treatment for its efficiency in coagulation. It helps in the aggregation of small particles into larger ones that settle down faster. Its effectiveness over a wide range of pH makes it suitable for various water conditions.

- Application Method: For underwater application, PAC can be released from tubes located on the bottom, allowing it to mix with the sediment effectively. For surface application, a diluted solution can be sprayed using a pressurized boat-mounted liquid sprayer, ensuring rapid mixing and coagulation.

- Environmental Impact: PAC is considered less corrosive and safer for aquatic life compared to traditional aluminum sulfate coagulants. It should still be used within recommended concentrations to minimize any potential impact.

- Cost Estimate: The cost can vary widely depending on the purity and formulation, but for water treatment purposes, it might range from $200 to $600 per ton.

Chitosan:

- Formula: (C6H11NO4)n

- Description: Chitosan is a natural biopolymer derived from chitin, which is found in the shells of crustaceans. It acts as a flocculant, binding to sediment particles and facilitating their removal from the water column.

- Application Method: Chitosan can be applied similarly, either from the bottom or sprayed from above, depending on the specific requirements and water dynamics of the diving area.

- Environmental Impact: Being a natural compound, chitosan is biodegradable and generally considered safe for marine environments. Its use should be carefully controlled to ensure it does not disrupt the natural balance.

- Cost Estimate: This is generally more expensive than PAC, with prices ranging from $15 to $50 per kilogram, depending on the quality and source.

### Application

Both chemicals can be applied from underwater tubes or sprayed from above using a pressurized system. Careful control of concentrations is essential to minimize environmental impact.

It's important to note that the actual feasibility, environmental impact, and cost-effectiveness of using these chemicals for underwater clarity enhancement should be thoroughly evaluated through pilot studies and environmental assessments. Additionally, local regulations and guidelines regarding the use of chemicals in aquatic environments must be strictly followed.

### Chemical Patent

Patenting chemicals involves a rigorous process to secure intellectual property rights over unique chemical substances and their applications. In Canada, chemical patents are governed by the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO), which requires that a chemical substance or composition be new, useful, and non-obvious to be patentable. Detailed descriptions of the chemical composition, its preparation process, and practical utility must be provided. Canada adheres to the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), which facilitates the filing of patents in multiple countries simultaneously.

In the United States, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) handles the patenting of chemicals, focusing heavily on the novelty, utility, and non-obviousness of the chemical invention. The process demands comprehensive details about the chemical structure, synthetic pathways, and specific uses. Additionally, the US has provisions for the protection of methods of using the chemicals. Meanwhile, in Europe, the European Patent Office (EPO) oversees chemical patents, which must demonstrate an inventive step that is not obvious to a person skilled in the art. The EPO also requires that the application include an example of the chemical's practical application, ensuring that the invention is industrially applicable. Like Canada, Europe is a participant in the PCT, simplifying international patent applications.
